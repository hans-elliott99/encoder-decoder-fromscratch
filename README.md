# encoder-decoder-fromscratch
Sequence 2 sequence translation in pytorch from 'scratch' (at the torch.tensor level)    

model is an encoder GRU -> decoder GRU with attention.  
data is for english to french translation.  

see [notebook](https://github.com/hans-elliott99/encoder-decoder-fromscratch/blob/main/examples/Seq2Seq_EN2FRTranslation.ipynb) in examples/ for example (colab avail)
